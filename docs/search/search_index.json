Turing test A computer passes the Turing test if a human interrogator cannot tell whether the answers from his written questions come from a human or a computer. The computer would need the following capabilities: natural language processing to communicate in natural language; knowledge representation to store what it knows or hears; automated reasoning to use stored information and to draw new conclusions; machine learning to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and explore patterns. Total Turing test Based on the Turing test and additionally requires that the subject can physically interact and see the other person using video. The computer would additionally need the following capabilities: computer vision to perceive objects; robotics to manipulate objects and move them. Thingking humanly Thinking humanly approach Once one has a sufficiently precise theory of the mind, one could write a computer program of it. If the input-output behavior matches human behavior, some inner workings of the program might correspond to human thinking. This approach is typically followed in cognitive sciences. Thinking rationally Rationality A system is rational if it does the \"right thing\", i.e., has an ideal performance (performance measures are not always available). Logics is often used to mimic rational thinking since it provides correct conclusions given correct premises, e.g.: Socrates is a man; all men are mortal; therefore, Socrates is mortal. Difficulties: Informal knowledge has to be formalized. Computational effort might be infeasible: Problems with a few hundred facts might exhaust the capabilities of today's computers. Acting rationally Agent An agent is just something that acts (Latin: agere, \"to do\" ). Rational agent A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome. Topics of this lecture Search: Problem is deterministic and goal state can be checked. Constraint satisfaction: It is only required to find a solution fulfilling constraints. Logics: Problem is deterministic, knowledge is given, and new knowledge should be inferred. Probabilistic reasoning: Problem is stochastic, knowledge is uncertain, model is given, and state of agent should be estimated. Rational decisions: Problem is stochastic, knowledge is uncertain, model is given, and best action of agent should be determined. Learning: Problem is stochastic, knowledge is uncertain, data/simulation instead of model is given, and best action of agent should be determined. This classification is not sharp. For instance, there are also search approaches for stochastic problems.
