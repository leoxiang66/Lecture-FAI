# Problem Solving
This chapter describes one kind of goal-based agent called a **problem-solving agent**. 

- Problem-solving agents use *atomic* representations, as described in Section 2.4.7-that is, states of the world are considered as wholes, with no internal structure visible to the problemsolving algorithms. 
- Goal-based agents that use more advanced factored or structured representations are usually called planning agents and are discussed in Chapters 7 and 10.

Content of this topic:

- precise definitions of problems and their solutions and give several examples to illustrate these definitions. 
- We then describe several general-purpose search algorithms that can be used to solve these problems. 
    - We will see several **uninformed search algorithms** that are given no information about the problem other than its definition. Although some of these algorithms can solve any solvable problem, none of them can do so efficiently. 
    - **Informed search algorithms**, on the other hand, can do quite well given some guidance on where to look for solutions.
