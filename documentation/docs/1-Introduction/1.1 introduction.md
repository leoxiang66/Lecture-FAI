### Acting humanly
The Turing test proposed by Alan Turing in 1950 tests whether a machine acts humanly.

**Turing test**
A computer passes the Turing test if a human interrogator cannot tell whether the answers from his written questions come from a human or a computer.

- The computer would need the following capabilities:
    - natural language processing to communicate in natural language;
    - knowledge representation to store what it knows or hears;
    - automated reasoning to use stored information and to draw new conclusions;
    - machine learning to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and explore patterns.


**Total Turing test**
Based on the Turing test and additionally requires that the subject can physically interact and see the other person using video.

- The computer would additionally need the following capabilities:
    - computer vision to perceive objects;
    - robotics to manipulate objects and move them.

## Thingking humanly
**Thinking humanly approach**
Once one has a sufficiently precise theory of the mind, one could write a computer program of it. If the input-output behavior matches human behavior, some inner workings of the program might correspond to human thinking.

- This approach is typically followed in cognitive sciences.

## Thinking rationally
**Rationality**
A system is rational if it does the "right thing", i.e., has an ideal performance (performance measures are not always available).

- Logics is often used to mimic rational thinking since it provides correct conclusions given correct premises, e.g.:
*Socrates is a man; all men are mortal; therefore, Socrates is mortal.*

Difficulties:

- Informal knowledge has to be formalized.
- Computational effort might be infeasible: Problems with a few hundred facts might exhaust the capabilities of today's computers.

## Acting rationally
**Agent**
An agent is just something that acts (Latin: agere, "to do" ).

**Rational agent**
A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome.

- Search: Problem is deterministic and goal state can be checked.
- Constraint satisfaction: It is only required to find a solution fulfilling constraints.
- Logics: Problem is deterministic, knowledge is given, and new knowledge should be inferred.
- Probabilistic reasoning: Problem is stochastic, knowledge is uncertain, model is given, and state of agent should be estimated.
- Rational decisions: Problem is stochastic, knowledge is uncertain, model is given, and best action of agent should be determined.
- Learning: Problem is stochastic, knowledge is uncertain, data/simulation instead of model is given, and best action of agent should be determined.

This classification is not sharp. For instance, there are also search approaches for stochastic problems.
